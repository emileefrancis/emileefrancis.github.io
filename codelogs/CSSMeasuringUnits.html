        <h1> Absolute units have a fixed size and do not change based on screen size, parent elements, or user settings.
            Relative units, on the other hand, are flexible and scale depending on another value-such as the font size
            of a
            parent element, the root element, or the viewport dimensions. These units are essential for responsive
            design
            because they adapt to different screen sizes and user preferences.</h1>

        <h2>px (Pixels)

            - An absolute unit.

            - Represents a single dot on the screen.

            - Commonly used in web design.

            - Although technically tied to screen resolution, browsers treat px as a consistent unit for layout.

            - Good for precise control, but not ideal for fully responsive typography.</h2>

    <h3>
        pt (Points)

        An absolute unit traditionally used in print.

        1pt = 1/72 of an inch.

        More common in print stylesheets than screen layouts.

        Not ideal for responsive web design.
